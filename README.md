Road Accident Analysis Dashboard
This project involves analyzing road accident data to uncover trends, patterns, and key insights. The final output is a dynamic dashboard with key performance indicators (KPIs) and a filter panel for better data exploration.

This project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of road accidents. It involves:

 - Cleaning and preparing the data to ensure accuracy.
 - Adding helper columns and using formulas to create new insights.
 - Building a dynamic dashboard to visualize the key findings.
 - Allowing users to filter data interactively to explore different scenarios.
Data Cleaning
 -- Removed blanks and inconsistencies: Ensured data quality by handling missing values and removing outliers.
 -- Consistency checks: Validated the data for accuracy.
Data Preparation
 -- Helper Columns: Added columns and pivot tables to facilitate calculations and improve the analysis.
 -- Formulas: Used Excel formulas to calculate relevant metrics such as accident rates, vehicle type involvement, etc.
Dashboard Features
 -- KPIs: Displayed key statistics such as the total number of accidents, fatalities, and vehicles involved.
 -- Dynamic Filters: Created a filter panel allowing users to filter by vehicle type, time, location, and other parameters.
 -- Interactive Visualizations: Included charts and tables to visualize trends over time, accident severity, and vehicle type involvement.
